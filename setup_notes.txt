* create the package.json file
    npm init -y

* Install webpack in dev
    npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev

* Create 2 files in the prject's root
    create folder and named it "src"
    inside src create a js file and named it "index.js"

* Para compilar el archivo index.js with webpack. This should create a new folder called "dist"
* In the dist folder you will find the main.js files that was compiled and executed by webpack
    npx webpack src/index.js

    * To test the compiled file main.js
        node dist/main.js

    * Now since we want to see our site in html let's intall a plugin
        npm install html-webpack-plugin --save-dev

        * In order to use this new plugin we need to create a new file in the root
            Create a file and name it "webpack.config.js"

    * Let's compile and test the main.js again but this time using the scripts from package.json
        * add a new script in the package.json: "build": "webpack" then run the below
        npm run build

* Now let's install the webpack dev server to host our html
    npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev

    * add a new script in the package.json: "dev": "webpack serve --mode development --env development" _
        then run the below
        npm run dev  ---> now you can test you site from the browser http://localhost:8080/

* Install babel core so it can understand jsx and others
    npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader --save-dev
    npm install @babel/preset-react --save-dev

    * Now configure the above in webpack.config.js and run your project again. HTML will be recognized


Para que el desarrollo sea más ágil y correcto
==============================================

* Install StandarJS
    npm install standard --save-dev

    * then add "lint": "standard", in the scripts section in package.json
